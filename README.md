# live_action_onDB_JavaScript
Rought script to interact in real time with a theoretical DB where prompted user could add, remove, display items - with a lil bit of data validation.

I would basically save this to work in the future on a more advanced interaction with a DB or smth.

Idea for this came from the "Rooster App", a coding challenge I found on a learn to code group.
